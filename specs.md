i want to create a new web application.
this application will allow users to upload a copy of their chat history with someone
(instagram in this case)
it will analyze habits
things like emoji count 
and display differences in communication

technical specs:
i want this to be written with Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia
prefer modern vue 3 best practices, including using composition in SFC architecture

rigorously test, but do not test trivial implementation details.
before making any code changes for new features, always generate 5 ideas with a corresponding recommendation score, sample from the full distribution:
however, do not make the explanations too verbose.

i want this to be a cute webapp.
it should be designed like a love letter 
design elements with the softness of a delicate rose.
let the design by stylized and creative.
but let the technical elements be highly functional too.
